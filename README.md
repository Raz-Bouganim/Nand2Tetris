# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my implementations of the projects from the **Nand2Tetris** course, officially known as *"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"*. The course, designed by **Shimon Schocken** and **Noam Nisan**, teaches how to construct a computer from the ground up, from logic gates to a high-level programming language.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates**  
   Implementation of basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT, leading to more complex gates.

2. **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**  
   Construction of arithmetic and logical chips, such as adders and ALU.

3. **Project 3: Memory**  
   Implementation of sequential chips like registers and RAM.

4. **Project 4: Machine Language**  
   Development of simple programs written in the Hack machine language.

5. **Project 5: Computer**  
   Construction of a complete 16-bit computer, capable of running Hack programs.

6. **Project 6: Assembler**  
   Implementation of an assembler to translate Hack assembly into machine language.

7. **Project 7: Virtual Machine I**  
   Development of a stack-based virtual machine, including memory access commands.

8. **Project 8: Virtual Machine II**  
   Extension of the virtual machine to include program flow and function calling.

9. **Project 9: BrickBreaker**  
   A custom interactive game written in the Jack language, implementing graphics and gameplay.

10. **Project 10: Compiler**  
    Construction of a compiler to translate Jack programs into VM code.

## About the Course

The Nand2Tetris course covers all the steps involved in building a computer, starting from NAND gates to creating a functional software stack. This hands-on approach provides
